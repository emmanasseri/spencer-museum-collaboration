## spencer-museum-collaboration

#Project description:

The collaboration identifies an irl “real estate” property with a problematic provenance. The collaboration also buys a correlate property in a metaverse. A series of 100 “claim” NFTs is issued as an administrative/nominal claim on the “real” property. The “claim” NFTs are minted to and issued in 100 individual paper wallets. Some of these wallets become part of the Museum collection while all others are distributed to particular identified communities. If an individual enters the wallet, the token is automated to send itself to the burn address. If at least 50/100 (can be more) wallet holders access their wallets together in a coordinated action, the burn process is different. In this use case, those 50 or more wallet holders engaging in the collective action would then have their “claim” tokens burned just as the individual user would. In addition to the burning of those “claim” tokens, however, each of those 50+ wallets would also be issued a new soul-bound NFT that represents a fractional ownership of the metaverse property purchased by the collective (mentioned in second sentence).
